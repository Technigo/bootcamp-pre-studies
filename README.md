# Pre-studies

Before you come to the course in March, it is important that you do a little pre-study work to make it so we can hit the ground running when you start. 

The topics you’ll cover are geared towards ensuring you have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — making sure you have an understanding of what they are, how they fit together, and how to write them.

---

## HTML
First and foremost, you need a basic understanding of HTML syntax - opening and closing tags,  and how to use attributes when writing tags.

For example, the HTML below creates a heading with the text “Welcome to Technigo!” and uses the "class" attribute to set the CSS class name “greeting”:

```html
<h1 class="greeting">Welcome to Technigo!</h1>
```

You don’t need to know all the HTML tags, or what attributes you can use - just to make sure you’re familiar with the syntax before you start.

### :memo: Tasks:
1. Read the [W3Schools Introduction to HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp)  page and make sure you’re familiar with the concepts. If you’re not, then read through some of the other categories in the sidebar.

## CSS
Similarly to HTML, we want to make sure you understand how to write CSS - how the syntax works. For example, the CSS below would target the `.greeting` header which we used in the HTML example and would make the text red:

```css
.greeting {
  color: red;
}
```

Again, you don’t need to know all of the available properties which you can set with CSS, but it is important that you know the syntax; how to write a selector, and define properties and values.

### :memo: Tasks
1. Read and make sure you’re familiar with this page from W3Schools: [CSS Syntax and Selectors](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_syntax.asp)

## JavaScript
From the 2nd sprint of the course, we’ll be focusing heavily on JavaScript. We will spend a lot of time working with it and getting familiar with it, but some of the concepts can be a little difficult to wrap your head around at first, so it’s good to start as early as possible.

To prepare for writing JavaScript, we’d like you to familiarise yourself with what JavaScript is, and the general syntax. Below is a list of topics to read through. At the end, you should be familiar with where you can write JavaScript, how to define a variable, and should be aware of some data types in JavaScript such as strings and numbers.

2. [JavaScript Where To](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_whereto.asp)
3. [JavaScript Output](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_output.asp)
4. [JavaScript Statements](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_statements.asp)
5. [JavaScript Syntax](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_syntax.asp)
6. [JavaScript Variables](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_variables.asp)
7. [JavaScript Data Types](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_datatypes.asp)

Optional (but nice to have!) extras:
1. [JavaScript Arrays](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp)
